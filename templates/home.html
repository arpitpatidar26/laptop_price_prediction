        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>
          The Laptop Price Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately forecasts the prices of laptop based on
          various specification and features. This project addresses the challenge of the diverse configuration availabe in the laptop market, where each
          models price can vary significantly due to factors such as CPU type, RAM size, storage options and brand. The process begins with data
          collection, utilizing dataset that include attributes like laptop model, RAM, GPU, CPU, Screen Size and more. Data preprocessing is crucial,
          invloving cleaning noisy data and performing feature engineering to enhance model performance. Exploratory data analysis(EDA) is conducted to identify
          relationships between features and prices, such as the correlation between RAM size and price, which often shows a strong positive relationship.
          The project employees machine learning algorithms, with multiple linear regression being a common choice, to predict prices based on the identified
          features. The effictiveness of the model is evaluated using matrix like RÂ² score and mean absolute error ensuring that the prediction are reliable
          and accurate for potential buyers seeking to understand the market better. Overall, this project not only serves as a practical application of 
          machine learning techniques but also provides valuable insights into the factors influencing laptop pricing in a competitive landscape.
